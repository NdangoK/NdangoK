Hello! I'm Ndango, I hold a BSc in Applied Mathematics and I am currently completing a BCom Hons in Financial Modelling. I am a curious and driven individual who enjoys turning data into actionable insights using tools like Excel, SQL, Python, R, and Power BI. As a fast learner and problem solver, I am always on the lookout for ways to improve and deliver impactful projects.
